As a learning experience, I recreated this data visualization from FiveThirtyEight's article, [Every Guest Jon Stewart Ever Had On ‘The Daily Show’](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/every-guest-jon-stewart-ever-had-on-the-daily-show/).

<img src="/img/daily-show-plot.png" width="500">

I learned about:
- Exploratory vs Explanatory visualization
- Pandas data wrangling and crosstabs
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas plotting

You can see details, including code and comments, in [my Colab Notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LYq3H6SjJ6iJhA65FbH-y-lQXDaT_6Bi/view?usp=sharing).
