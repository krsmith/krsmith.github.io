## What makes a NY Times Best Seller?

Aspiring writers often struggle to figure out the best way to create a career doing what they love. Using the NY Times best sellers list, I want to create visualizations that will help understand trends over time. Authors will be able to use this information to determine genre, themes, and target publishers.

Can following these trends guarantee that a book will hit the best seller's list? There is a lot more to a book than title, publisher, and genre. This project can't determine quality of writing or marketing strategies, but it should help to show trends in what is selling. 

Another complication is determining what will be selling once your book is published, which could take years. The trend of this year could drop by the time your book hits the shelves, but a consistent trend could last a decade or more.
