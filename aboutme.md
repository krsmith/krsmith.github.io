My name is Kailey Smith and I am a data scientist with a Masters degree in Information Systems from the University of Utah.

I have a background in analyzing complex healthcare insurance data and employer benefit programs.

### Data
I was first introduced to the world of data during my time in the MSIS program. I continued on this path throughout my career with healthcare companies using tools such as Microsoft Excel and many flavors of SQL. I have since discovered the power of Python and the multiple libaries that come along with it.

#### Cleaning and Visualizing
I prototype in Jupyter Notebook, with pandas to wrangle, matplotlib and seaborn to visualize, and scikit-learn to model.

#### Healthcare
Throughout my career in the healthcare field I have been exposed to some very interesting, yet also complex, data. I believe that experience will continue to allow me to analyze and discover many data science solutions that would benefit any company.

### Leadership
I have lead teams of data managers, ETL engineers and SQL engineers as the Director of Data Engineering at Artemis Health. Being in this role lead me to work closely with the leadership of the company to guide and direct our employees toward achieving company objectives and initiatives.
